# Here lies The system specification for a dream like rpg system written when Iâ€™m sleep deprived.

The goal of this system is to give flexibility to the players to imagine there own power and create what they want to see.

Each character is has the following stats:
|Brawn|How strong they are|
|Reflex|How Agile they are|
|Whits|How clever they are|
|tact|how well they handle in social situations |
|Grit| How physically Tough they are|
|Composure|How mentally Tough they are|

Each of these stats start at 2 and can be improved by boosts that are given during character creation.  A single stat cannot go above 5 or 9 if using the extended rules.

Each player can also have Boons or Busts for each of the stat categories.  They should have at least 2 boons and 2 Busts.  

**During character create a player can:**
- exchange a stat point increase for a Bust to that attribute 
- exchange a Boon for stat point decrease in the same category.

These are usually pulled from that characters backstory for example if there was a character who was a Programmer who as a hobby liked to cycle that character would have the `Logical` Boon and a `Cyclist` Boon which could be applied to certain skill task to add a die.

In addition to Stats and Boons/Busts a player has 3 sets of stress tracks.  

Physical, Mental and Emotional these tracks line up with the stats as follows:
|Physical| Brawn, Reflex|
|Mental| Whits, Grit|
|Emotional|Composure, tact|


### Stress Tracks
A stress track is composed of three levels and if all three levels are filled that character must make a Sanity Save which if they pass reduces their stress by one but it they fail that character perishes.

Each level of the stress track has 5 points and if you have a previously level on that stress track filled you will soak a stress for each **Level** in the stress track filled.

#### Reducing Stress

### Long Rest:
Whenever you take a long rest you can make a heal roll by rolling dice equal to your lowest stat related to that stress track.  Ie if you want to reduce Physical stress you can roll dice equal your Brawn or Reflex which ever is lower.

### Reduce Stress via taking a Bust
If you do not have time to take a long rest you may remove one completed track by taking a Bust.  Each Bust taken this way will be assigned a duration based on what track
